Day 1: **Install Docker Packages and Start Docker Service** 
The Nautilus DevOps team aims to containerize various applications following a recent meeting with the application development team. They intend to conduct testing with the following steps:
Install docker-ce and docker compose packages on App Server 3.

Initiate the docker service.

Ans:
# Install using the rpm repository: 
sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
# Install Docker Engine
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

Day 2: **Deploy Nginx Container on Application Server** 
The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 2. Complete the task with the following instructions:

On Application Server 2 create a container named nginx_2 using the nginx image with the alpine tag. Ensure container is in a running state.
Ans:
docker pull nginx:alpine
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx_2 nginx:alpine
docker ps
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' nginx_2
curl 172.12.0.2

Day 3: **Delete Docker Container** 
To delete the `kke-container` from **App Server 3** in Stratos DC, follow these steps:
### üßπ Steps to Remove the Container

1. **Access App Server 3**  
   First, SSH into App Server 3. If you're using a bastion host or jump server, make sure to route through it:
   
   ssh user@appserver3
2. **Verify the container exists**  
   Run:
   docker ps -a | grep kke-container
   
  This confirms the container is present and shows its status.

3. **Stop the container (if running)**  
   docker stop kke-container

4. **Remove the container**  
    docker rm kke-container
   
5. **Confirm deletion**  
   Run:
      docker ps -a
      Ensure `kke-container` no longer appears in the list.

### ‚úÖ Don't Forget:
If the container was created with volumes or networks, you might want to clean those up too:
docker volume prune
docker network prune

Day 4: **Copy File to Docker Container**
The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on App Server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named ubuntu_latest is running on the same server. Copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from the docker host to the ubuntu_latest container located at /tmp/. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

Ans:
To copy the encrypted file `/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg` from the Docker host to the `ubuntu_latest` container without modifying it, follow these steps:

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Identify the container ID or name**  
   Since the container is named `ubuntu_latest`, you can confirm it's running with:   
   docker ps
   
   Look for the container named `ubuntu_latest` and note its **CONTAINER ID** if needed.

2. **Copy the file into the container**  
   Use the `docker cp` command to copy the file from the host to the container:
   
   docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg

   This command ensures the file is transferred **as-is**, preserving its encrypted state.

3. **Verify the file inside the container (optional)**  
   You can exec into the container to confirm the file exists:
   
   docker exec -it ubuntu_latest ls -l /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg

Day 5 **Troubleshoot Docker Container Issue**
An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details:

Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.

Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.

Ans:
To troubleshoot the static website issue on App Server 1 with the container named `nautilus`, follow these steps:

### üîç Step 1: Check Volume Mapping

Ensure that the container's internal path `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` is correctly mapped to the host's `/var/www/html`.

1. **Inspect the container:**
   
   docker inspect nautilus
   

2. **Look for the `Mounts` section** in the output. You should see something like:
   json
   "Mounts": [
     {
       "Type": "bind",
       "Source": "/var/www/html",
       "Destination": "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs",
       ...
     }
   ]
   

   ‚úÖ If this mapping is present, the volume is correctly configured.

   ‚ùå If not, you may need to recreate the container with the correct volume mapping:
   
   docker run -d --name nautilus -p 8080:80 -v /var/www/html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs httpd

### üåê Step 2: Verify Website Accessibility on Port 8080

1. **Check if the container is running:**
   
   docker ps

   Ensure `nautilus` is listed and port `8080` is mapped to container port `80`.

2. **Test with curl:**
   
   curl http://localhost:8080/
   

   ‚úÖ If you see HTML output or the expected page content, the site is accessible.

   ‚ùå If you get an error (e.g., connection refused), check:
   - Whether the container is running.
   - Whether port `8080` is correctly mapped.
   - Whether the container has content in `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs`.

**Final Test Question:**

List all Docker images with their sizes:
docker images --format "table {{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}\t{{.ID}}"
Delete those images:

docker images --format "{{.ID}} {{.Size}}" | while read id size; do
  num=$(echo $size | grep -oE '^[0-9]+')
  unit=$(echo $size | grep -oE '[A-Z]+$')
  if [ "$unit" = "MB" ] && [ "$num" -gt 100 ]; then
    docker rmi -f "$id"
  fi
done
Verify Cleanup:
docker images

Q7:
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to do some cleanup on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter, some old and unused docker networks need to be deleted. Find below more details:


Delete a docker network named php-network from App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.
Ans:
To delete the Docker network named `php-network` on **App Server 3**, run the following command:


docker network rm php-network


### ‚úÖ Before You Run It:
You can verify the network exists with:

docker network ls | grep php-network


If the network is currently in use by any containers, you'll need to disconnect them first:

docker network disconnect php-network <container_name_or_id>


Q8:
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to setup/create some docker containers on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter, some prerequisites are needs to be done on this server. Find below more details:

Create a new network named mysql-network using the bridge driver. Allocate subnet 182.18.0.0/24, configure Gateway 182.18.0.1.
Ans:
To create the Docker network `mysql-network` with the specified subnet and gateway on **App Server 3**, run the following command:

docker network create \
  --driver bridge \
  --subnet 182.18.0.0/24 \
  --gateway 182.18.0.1 \
  mysql-network

### ‚úÖ What this does:
- `--driver bridge`: Uses the bridge network driver.
- `--subnet`: Allocates the IP range `182.18.0.0/24`.
- `--gateway`: Sets the gateway to `182.18.0.1`.
- `mysql-network`: Names the network.

### üîç Verify the network:

docker network inspect mysql-network

You‚Äôll see the subnet and gateway listed in the output.

Q9:
There was a docker container deployed on App Server 3. Suddenly, team found that the container is crashing. Look into the issue to fix the same, you can find more details below:


The container name is apple_alpine. You can even re-create the container if needed, just make sure its in running state

To troubleshoot and resolve the issue with the `apple_alpine` container on **App Server 3**, follow these steps:

### üîç Step 1: Check Container Status and Logs

docker ps -a | grep apple_alpine
docker logs apple_alpine

This will show whether the container exited and why. Common issues include missing commands, misconfigured entrypoints, or missing images.

### üîß Step 2: Remove and Re-create the Container
If the container is crashing and logs don‚Äôt help, it‚Äôs best to re-create it cleanly:

docker rm -f apple_alpine
docker run -d --name apple_alpine alpine sleep 1000

- `alpine`: Uses the lightweight Alpine Linux image.
- `sleep 1000`: Keeps the container running for a long time.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify It's Running

docker ps -f name=apple_alpine

You should see the container listed with status `Up`.
