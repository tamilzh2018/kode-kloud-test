# Q1 Custom Apache User Setup

In response to heightened security concerns, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted for custom Apache users for their web applications. Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. Your task is to create a custom Apache user according to the outlined specifications:

a. Create a user named mark on App server 3 within the Stratos Datacenter.

b. Assign a unique UID 1781 and designate the home directory as /var/www/mark.
Ans:
To create a custom Apache user named `mark` with the specified UID and home directory on **App Server 3** in the **Stratos Datacenter**, follow these steps:

### üßë‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Create the user with custom UID and home directory**
   - Run the following command:
  
     sudo useradd -u 1781 -d /var/www/mark -m mark
  
   - Explanation:
     - `-u 1781` sets the UID.
     - `-d /var/www/mark` sets the home directory.
     - `-m` ensures the home directory is created if it doesn‚Äôt exist.

2. **Verify the user creation**
   - Check the user details:
  
     id mark
  
   - Confirm the home directory:
  
     ls -ld /var/www/mark

# Q2 Group Creation and User Assignment
The system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries has streamlined access management by implementing group-based access control. Here's what you need to do:


a. Create a group named nautilus_noc across all App servers within the Stratos Datacenter.


b. Add the user sonya into the nautilus_noc group on all App servers. If the user doesn't exist, create it as well.

Ans:
To implement group-based access control as requested, follow these steps on **each App server** within the **Stratos Datacenter**:

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

#### a. **Create the group `nautilus_noc`**

sudo groupadd nautilus_noc

- This creates the group if it doesn't already exist.
- If the group exists, the command will return an error‚Äîbut it's safe to ignore.

#### b. **Add the user `sonya` to the group**
1. **Check if the user exists**:
   
   id sonya
   
   - If the user does **not** exist, create her:
     
     sudo useradd sonya
     

2. **Add `sonya` to the `nautilus_noc` group**:
   
   sudo usermod -aG nautilus_noc sonya
   

3. **Verify group membership**:
   
   groups sonya
   
   - You should see `nautilus_noc` listed among her groups.

### üîÅ Repeat on All App Servers
Run the above steps on **App Server 1**, **App Server 2**, and **App Server 3** to ensure consistent access control across the datacenter.

# Q3 Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell
Create a user named kirsty with a non-interactive shell on App Server 1.

Ans: 
#### a. **Create a user `kristy`**
sudo useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin kirsty

# Q4 Service User Creation without Home Directory

In response to the latest tool implementation at xFusionCorp Industries, the system admins require the creation of a service user account. Here are the specifics:

Create a user named siva in App Server 1 without a home directory.
Ans:
# Create the User Without a Home Directory
sudo useradd siva -M  **-M ensures no home directory is created.**
id siva
# Confirm the Home Directory Is Not Created
ls -ld /home/siva
You should see: ls: cannot access '/home/siva': No such file or directory

# Q5 Temporary User Setup with Expiry
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named mark requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:

Create a user named mark on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-01-28, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.
Ans:
sudo useradd mark -e 2024-01-28

sudo chage -l mark
# Q6 Linux User Data Transfer
Due to an accidental data mix-up, user data was unintentionally mingled on Nautilus App Server 2 at the /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. To rectify this, specific user data needs to be filtered and relocated. Here are the details:

Locate all files (excluding directories) owned by user mariyam within the /home/usersdata directory on App Server 2. Copy these files while preserving the directory structure to the /media directory.

Ans:
# Run the following find command:
find /home/usersdata -type f -user mariyam -exec cp --parents {} /media \;
# Verify that the files have been copied with structure preserved:
find /news -type f

# Q7 Secure Root SSH Access
Following security audits, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.

Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

To disable **direct SSH root login** on all **app servers** in the **Stratos Datacenter**, follow these steps:
Ans:
### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions

 **SSH into each app server**
   You‚Äôll need to access each app server individually. The naming pattern might be something like:

   * `stapp01`
   * `stapp02`
   * `stapp03`
     *(Replace with actual hostnames/IPs if different)*   
   ssh user@stapp01
   **Check where the value inside config files avail**
  sudo grep -i permitrootlogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
  **Replace those yes to no**
  sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  **Verify and restart**
  sudo sshd -T | grep permitrootlogin
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
# Q8 Data Backup for Developer
Within the Stratos DC, the Nautilus storage server hosts a directory named /data, serving as a repository for various developers non-confidential data. Developer james has requested a copy of their data stored in /data/james. The System Admin team has provided the following steps to fulfill this request:

a. Create a compressed archive named james.tar.gz of the /data/james directory.

b. Transfer the archive to the /home directory on the Storage Server.
Ans:

### ‚úÖ **Step a: Create a compressed archive**

Create a `tar.gz` archive of the `/data/james` directory:


tar -czf /tmp/james.tar.gz /data/james


* `tar` ‚Äì archive command
* `-c` ‚Äì create archive
* `-z` ‚Äì compress using gzip
* `-f` ‚Äì filename of the archive
* `/tmp/james.tar.gz` ‚Äì path to the archive file (temporary location)
* `/data/james` ‚Äì source directory



### ‚úÖ **Step b: Move the archive to `/home`**

Transfer the archive to the `/home` directory:


mv /tmp/james.tar.gz /home/


Now the file `/home/james.tar.gz` contains the compressed copy of James's data.



### ‚úÖ Final Check:

You can verify the archive is in the correct place:


ls -l /home/james.tar.gz


You should see the file listed with its size and timestamp.

Let me know if you'd like to automate this with a script or cronjob.


# Q9 Script Execution Permissions
In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter.

Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 2. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.
Ans:
chmod a+rx /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

# Q10 File Permission Correction
After conducting a security audit within the Stratos DC, the Nautilus security team discovered misconfigured permissions on critical files. To address this, corrective actions are being taken by the production support team. Specifically, the file named /etc/hostname on Nautilus App 2 server requires adjustments to its Access Control Lists (ACLs) as follows:

1. The file's user owner and group owner should be set to root.

2. Others should possess read only permissions on the file.

3. User mariyam must not have any permissions on the file.

4. User ryan should be granted read only permission on the file.
Ans:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set ownership to `root:root`
sudo chown root:root /etc/hostname

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set base permissions so "others" have read-only access
sudo chmod 644 /etc/hostname

Explanation:

* Owner: read/write (`rw-`)
* Group: read-only (`r--`)
* Others: read-only (`r--`)
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove all permissions for user `mariyam` using ACL
sudo setfacl -m u:mariyam:0 /etc/hostname

OR use `--remove-all` if needed:

sudo setfacl -x u:mariyam /etc/hostname
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Grant **read-only** permission to user `ryan` using ACL

sudo setfacl -m u:ryan:r-- /etc/hostname

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify All Settings

# Check ownership
ls -l /etc/hostname

# Check ACLs
getfacl /etc/hostname

## üîç Expected Outcome

# ls -l output
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root ... /etc/hostname

# getfacl output
# file: /etc/hostname
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
user:mariyam:
user:ryan:r--
group::r--
other::r--
